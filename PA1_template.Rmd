```
First few rows of data and descriptive summary of its variables shown above. There are `r dim[1]` records in the dataset.

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r echo=TRUE}
total_steps_day <- with(data, aggregate(steps ~ date,FUN=sum))
mean_total_steps <- round(mean(total_steps_day$steps))
```
On average the total number of daily steps was `r mean_total_steps`.

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
